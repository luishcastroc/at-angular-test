# Task 2: Edit Functionality

**User Story**

> As a user of this application,
> I want to edit the items in my list,
> so that I can keep the information up to date.

**Notes**:

- Add an "Edit" button next to each item in the list
  - When clicked, the corresponding item's text should become editable, preferably within the same location in the list
  - After editing, the user should be able to save the changes to the item, which should immediately reflect in the list
  - Store the updated item information in the Data Service

**Routing Details**:

To implement routing for this task, follow these steps:

1. Configure a new route for Task 2 in the routing module, pointing to the `Task2Component`.
2. Update the navigation menu to include a link to Task 2 that navigates to the route for `Task2Component`.

**When finished**:

Proceed to [Task 3](../task3/README.md)
