# Task 4: Tracking Selected Item

**User Story**

> As a user of this application,
> I want to select an item from my list,
> so that I can view and interact with it in other parts of the application.

**Notes**:

- Extend the Data Service to support tracking a selected item from the list
  - A selected item should be highlighted or otherwise indicated in the list
  - The selected item should be accessible in other components via the Data Service

**Routing Details**:

To implement routing for this task, follow these steps:

1. Configure a new route for Task 4 in the routing module, pointing to the `Task4Component`.
2. Update the navigation menu to include a link to Task 4 that navigates to the route for `Task4Component`.

**When finished**:

Proceed to [Task 5](../task5/README.md)
