# Task 8: User Experience Enhancement

**User Story**

> As a user of this application,
> I want the application to remember my item list between visits,
> so that I don't lose my data when I close the application.

**Notes**:

- Implement a feature that allows the application to remember the list of items across browser sessions.
  - The state of the item list should be preserved even if the application is refreshed or closed.
  - The items should be available immediately upon reopening or refreshing the application.

**Routing Details**:

To implement routing for this task, follow these steps:

1. Configure a new route for Task 8 in the routing module, pointing to the `Task8Component`.
2. Update the navigation menu to include a link to Task 8 that navigates to the route for `Task8Component`.

**When finished**:

Congratulations! You have completed all the tasks. Review your code and commit your changes.
