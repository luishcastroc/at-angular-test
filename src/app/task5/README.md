# Task 5: Data Transformation

**User Story**

> As a user of this application,
> I want to see a different view of my list of items,
> so that I can gain new insights from the data.

**Notes**:

- Transform the data stream from the Data Service so that it only emits under certain conditions
  - For example, it could be a condition that the list length is even
- Display the transformed data in a new component

**Routing Details**:

To implement routing for this task, follow these steps:

1. Configure a new route for Task 5 in the routing module, pointing to the `Task5Component`.
2. Update the navigation menu to include a link to Task 5 that navigates to the route for `Task5Component`.

**When finished**:

Proceed to [Task 6](../task6/README.md)
