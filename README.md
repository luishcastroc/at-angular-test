# Angular Advanced Knowledge Exercise

Welcome to the Angular Advanced Knowledge Exercise. This exercise consists of a series of tasks designed to evaluate your proficiency in Angular development. Each task focuses on a different aspect of Angular development and will challenge you to implement solutions using Angular's features and best practices.

## Getting Started

Firstly, install the necessary dependencies.

```node
npm install
```

You can start the application with `npm start` and then navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser. The application is set up with routing, and you will be building out the functionality for several routes as part of the exercise.

## Instructions

The exercise consists of 8 tasks. Each task is described in a separate README.md file located in its own folder (e.g., `/src/app/task1/README.md`). You should work through the tasks in order, starting from Task 1.

Each task contains a User Story that describes the feature to be implemented, along with some additional notes. Your goal is to implement the functionality described in the User Story using Angular. You should take into account the following:

- The quality of your code. Is it clean, organized, and understandable?
- The correctness of your solution. Does it fulfill the requirements set out in the User Story?
- Your use of Angular's features and best practices.

## Tasks

- [Task 1: List Management Interface](./src/app/task1/README.md)
- [Task 2: Edit Functionality](./src/app/task2/README.md)
- [Task 3: Route Protection Based on Data](./src/app/task3/README.md)
- [Task 4: Tracking Selected Item](./src/app/task4/README.md)
- [Task 5: Data Transformation](./src/app/task5/README.md)
- [Task 6: Unit Testing](./src/app/task6/README.md)
- [Task 7: Advanced TypeScript Features](./src/app/task7/README.md)
- [Task 8: User Experience Enhancement](./src/app/task8/README.md)
- [Task 9 (Optional): Reusable Component](./src/app/task9/README.md)

## Navigation Menu

You should create a navigation menu to easily navigate through the tasks. The menu should be placed at the top, bottom, or in a location that you consider best for the user experience. The menu should provide links to each task, allowing the user to jump to a specific task's README file for instructions and implementation details.

## Routing Details

To implement routing for each task, follow these steps:

1. Create a new component for each task (e.g., `Task1Component`, `Task2Component`, etc.).
2. Configure a new route for each task in the routing module, pointing to the respective component.
3. Update the navigation menu to include links to each task, navigating to their respective routes.

After completing each task, please commit your changes with a message describing what you've done. Once you've finished all the tasks, make a final commit.

Good luck and have fun!
